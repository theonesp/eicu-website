# Identifiers

Identifiers are used across the database to identify unique concepts such as patients, hospitals, ICU stays, and so on. These identifiers include:

* A unique `hospitalid`, which is assigned to each hospital in the database.

* A unique `patienthealthsystemsstayid`, which is assigned to each hospital stay (the equivalent of MIMIC's `hadm_id`)

* A unique `patientunitstayid`, which is assigned to each ICU stay (the equivalent of MIMIC's `icustay_id`)

* A `uniquepid` which links patients across multiple hospital stays, this is the actual unique patient identifier (the equivalent of MIMIC's `subject_id`).
